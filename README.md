# 1. Kick-off

Robotcode website is http://robocode.sourceforge.net/.


## 1.1 Understand the Game 

(Taken from * [Your first robot](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/My_First_Robot))

__Aim of the game:___ Creating a Robot

Here's the fun stuff: This is what Robocode is all about! Creating a robot can be easy. Making your robot a winner is not. You can spend only a few minutes on it, or you can spend months and months. I'll warn you that writing a robot can be addictive! Once you get going, you'll watch your creation as it goes through growing pains, making mistakes and missing critical shots. But as you learn, you'll be able to teach your robot how to act and what to do, where to go, who to avoid, and where to fire. Should it hide in a corner, or jump into the fray?

* SCALA:      See the (Scala project)[https://github.com/rabbitonweb/robotcode_scala/blob/master/Tanks.scala] and modify it with your Maven/Gradle/plain_old_javac
* OTHER_JVM:  From official wiki http://robowiki.net/wiki/Other_JVM_Languages
* .NET        Please read [Robotcode Wiki](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/.NET/Create_a_.NET_robot_with_Visual_Studio])

## 1.3 Setting up local game server (for testing)


# 2. Chamberconf Tournament!

* You can develop your robot alone or you can team up with your friends
* Give your robot unique name (your first&last name, your team's name)
* Keep your class under `package 'chamberconf`
* We code for 15 min our robots, after that we'll run a tournament!
* While robots are fighting you can continue with the development
* We continue this cycle until 4 pm
* At 4pm we will run the final battle, were a winner (winning robot) will be selected
* Join with your laptop at any time during the conference. It does not matter when u will join. If u leave (stop developemnt) your robot will continue fighting and will take part in the final battle at 4pm
